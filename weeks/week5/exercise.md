# Exercise 4.3 - Controls

Add a set of forms/buttons, that may allow editing (modify/delete) the current exams, and insert new ones.

# Exercise 5.1 - Loading the exam list
Generate the exam list dynamically, by loading them from a dedicated JavaScript array (`ExamList`) and display it in the table present on the webpage. Use suitable DOM manipulation methods.

# Exercise 5.2 - Deleting an exam
Implement the exam removal, from the webpage list, in JavaScript. To do so, you have to define an `EventListener` in a suitable place (in the code) for each deletion buttons.

Please, notice that after reloading the page, all the exams will appear again (i.e., the deletion is not persistent).
